        <p>
          ANTLR is a - as the name itself suggests "Another Tool for Language Recognition" developed by Terence Parr. I started using it a while ago and found it very intuitive to learn basics is language recognition and implementation. 
          ANTLR is designed for both Java and .NET Framework. For reference please take a look at <a href="www.antlr.org">www.antlr.org</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started this project not only to extend, but also to share my knowledge and skills in language recognition and implementation with ANTRL. Unfortunatelly there are not too much sources around (esspecially for .NET and C#), so I think this could be helpful on first place to myself but also to others, who intend to learn about these topics.

          <a id="about-description" class="anchor" href="#about-description" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The List Comprehension Tool</h3>
        <p>
        As I was thinking for which language (or part of a language) I could try to build a parser and an "interpreter", I remembered a feature I found cool in Haskell - the list comprehensions.
        For those who are not familar with Haskell and list comprehensions, please take a look at <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/List_comprehension">this</a> page.
        Of cource you can do a lot of cool things with this in Haskell, and I'm not trying to build a full copy of it, but I'm going to try to cover as much as I can through this project.
        So I don't have either the intetion to develop a new new functional programming language, but maybe one day... :)

          The list comprehension tool (LCT) is an interactive command line tool which processes the input and and shows immidiatelly the a result.

          <a id="how-to-use-it" class="anchor" href="#how-to-use-it" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to use it</h3>
        <p>  
          You can start the LCT by double clicking the LCT.exe. The blue LCT console window with a prompt appears (see Picture 1) awaiting the user to enter LCT instructions. 
          <div>
            <img src="Screen1.PNG" />
          </div>    
          If accessing the LCT through command line, you can turn back to the command line by pressing Ctrl+C keys.
          The LCT allows following instructions:
          <ul>
            <li>defining lists for later use</li>
            <li>show defined lists </li>
            <li>list manipulation </li>
          </ul>
        To define a list you have to use the keyword "def" followed by the list name and the list itself (elements) in square brackets.
        <br />
        An example is given on following Picture.
          <div>
            <img src="Screen2.PNG" />
          </div>
        On incorrect syntactical input, the LCT console will display an error pointing out to the location through line and character number.
        Following screen shows what happens if the user enters an additional square bracket to the element list.
        <div>
            <img src="Screen3.PNG" />
          </div>
        After defining a list, with the show command you can display all defined lists currently held in memory.
        <div>
            <img src="Screen4.PNG" />
          </div>
        If you define a second list with the same name of an existing list, the elements of the existing list will be overwritten with ne defined values.
        <div>
            <img src="Screen5.PNG" />
          </div>
        Another possiblity to define a list is by pointing or referencing an existing list. Any changes to the referenced list will be reflected to the referencing list.
          <div>
            <img src="Screen6.PNG" />
          </div>
        Now it's time to show the list combination part. It consist of the formula part, and the list definition part. Later on conditions will be added to filter out the result.
        But for now, it's just possible to manipulate on the list and combine them according to the formula.
        The simple example on prints out just the list elments.
          <div>
            <img src="Screen7.PNG" />
          </div>
        More complex example shows the list comprehension using one defined list from memory and two lists directly defined in the instruction.
         <div>
            <img src="Screen8.PNG" />
          </div>
        As you can see, the elments of all lists are combined and calculated to a final result according to the formula.
