        <p>
          ANTLR is a - as the name itself suggests "Another Tool for Language Recognition" developed by Terence Parr. I started using it a while ago and found it very intuitive to learn basics is language recognition and implementation. 
          ANTLR is designed for both Java and .NET Framework. For reference please take a look at <a href="www.antlr.org">www.antlr.org</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started this project not only to extend, but also to share my knowledge and skills in language recognition and implementation with ANTRL. Unfortunatelly there are not too much sources around (esspecially for .NET and C#), so I think this could be helpful on first place to myself but also to others, who intend to learn about these topics.

          <a id="about-description" class="anchor" href="#about-description" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The List Comprehension Tool</h3>
        <p>
        As I was thinking for which language (or part of a language) I could try to build a parser and an "interpreter", I remembered a feature I found cool in Haskell - the list comprehensions.
        For those who are not familar with Haskell and list comprehensions, please take a look at <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/List_comprehension">this</a> page.
        Of cource you can do a lot of cool things with this in Haskell, and I'm not trying to build a full copy of it, but I'm going to try to cover as much as I can through this project.
        So I don't have either the intetion to develop a new new functional programming language, but maybe one day... :)
        </p>
        <p>
          The list comprehension tool (LCT) is an interactive command line tool which processes the input and and shows immidiatelly the a result.

        <p>  
          You can start the LCT by double clicking the LCT.exe. The blue LCT console window with a prompt appears (see Picture 1).
